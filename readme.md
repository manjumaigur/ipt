# IPT: Indic Pretrained Transformer

IPT is an Indic large language model series being trained on 15 indian languages. This is a follow up effort to [KPT](https://github.com/manjumaigur/kpt).

Features:

-   A new tokenizer
-   Models trained on indian languages (& small dataset of english) to learn the nuances of the languages and inter language relationships.

> This is a fun experiment and not an LLM model to be taken seriously.
